## Steedos DX

With Steedos DX, metadata can be imported into Steedos, modified in the product interface, and synchronize back to project source code. 

Steedos DX introduces a new way to organize your metadata and distribute your apps. You can benefit from modern collaboration technologies such as Git to version control everything across your team - your code, your org configuration, and your metadata. 

To make this possible, we're enabling you to export your metadata, define data import files, and easily specify the edition, features, and configuration options of your development, staging, and production environments.
